    "\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "The zygotes (cells resulting from the combination of one egg gamete and one sperm gamete) of one generation are formed from a sub-sampling of gametes from the parental population. This sub-sample inevitably is an imperfect representation of the alleles found in the parental population. **This sampling error results in chance fluctuations in allele frequency across generations, known as genetic drift.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Genetic drift is one of the five forces that can cause evolutionary change - the loss (where the allele frequency becomes 0) versus fixation (the allele frequency becomes 1) of an allele can be caused by genetic drift. \n",
    "\n",
    "Quantitatively, we can think of the drawing of two different alleles (let's designate them as A and a) for one gene in gametes as Bernoulli binomial sampling, so the expected change in the allele frequency of a selectively neutral allele A (which we will designate in the code below as the variable p) corresponds to the variance of the binomial distribution."
