    "## Population Genetics Exercise 1: Modeling Genetic Drift\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "The zygotes (cells resulting from the combination of one egg gamete and one sperm gamete) of one generation are formed from a sub-sampling of gametes from the parental population. This sub-sample inevitably is an imperfect representation of the alleles found in the parental population. **This sampling error results in chance fluctuations in allele frequency across generations, known as genetic drift.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Genetic drift is one of the five forces that can cause evolutionary change - the loss (where the allele frequency becomes 0) versus fixation (the allele frequency becomes 1) of an allele can be caused by genetic drift.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise (and all other exercises), we'll consider a hypothetical gene with two different alleles designated A and a. The A allele encodes a dominant phenotype of interest, while the a allele encodes a recessive phenotype of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantitatively, we can think of the drawing of the alleles A and a for our hypothetical gene in gametes as Bernoulli binomial sampling, so the expected change in the allele frequency of a ***selectively neutral* allele A** (which we will designate in the code below as the variable p) corresponds to the variance of the binomial distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reminder:** selectively neutral here means there is no selective advantage or disadvantage to an organism with the allele A that displays the dominant phenotype."
