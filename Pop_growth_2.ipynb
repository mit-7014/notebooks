    "## Population Growth Exercise 2: Modeling Populations in Discrete Time\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "Population growth can be more complicated than what we saw in Exercise 1. For example, population growth in some cases can **\"overshoot\"** or surpass the carrying capacity (K), depending upon the paramters in the logistic growth model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will explore a simple but important assumption used to model population growth. The previous exercise used calculus to model the **instantaneous** rate of change of populations. In reality, most populations reproduce in **discrete** generations, which can lead to interesting dynamics over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "By considering population growth in \"discrete time\", we can see how populations grow, reach carrying capacity, and potentially overshoot the carrying capacity. It also showcases how seemingly predictable systems can exhibit unpredictable behavior due to a range of realistic conditions experienced in nature."
