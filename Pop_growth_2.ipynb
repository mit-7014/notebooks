    "## Population Growth Exercise 2: Overshoot and Logistic Map\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "Population growth can be more complicated than what we saw in Exercise 1. For example, population growth in some cases can **\"overshoot\"** or surpass the carrying capacity (K), depending upon the paramters in the logistic growth model. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we are going to explore a simple but important mathematical model in population growth known as the **logistic map**. The logistic map serves as a powerful model for understanding complex systems in various fields. The logistic map demonstrates how populations grow, reach carrying capacity, and potentially overshoot. It also showcases how seemingly predictable systems can exhibit unpredictable behavior due to sensitive dependence on initial conditions."
