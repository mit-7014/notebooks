    "## Population Growth Exercise 3: Virtual Fishery\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "Fishery management relies on understanding how fish populations change over time. This field of study, called fishery population dynamics, considers factors like birth rates, growth, death (from fishing and natural causes), and movement of fish. By analyzing these dynamics, scientists can explain fluctuations in fish populations and predict the effects of threats like habitat loss, predation, and fishing pressure. Ultimately, fishery population dynamics helps determine how much fish can be sustainably harvested from a population.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the models before with logistic and exponential growth, we provide you with two ways of exploring population dynamics in a virtual fishery.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the following code, which constructs a simple fishery, simulating some of the data and decisions a fishery manager would have to think about. The harvest input parameter, H, has been set to 0 (but you can set H to anything you like to see what happens to the fish population). See the #comments to identify the other purposes of various parts in the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "This code simulates a very simplistic fishery. All the fish are in one place, and you can choose to harvest as many as you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you manage the fishery sustainably?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a fishery where the fish population grows logistically according to the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\frac{dN}{dt} = rN(1-N/K)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:    \n",
    "            \n",
    "           N = number of fish\n",
    "\n",
    "           t = time\n",
    "           \n",
    "           r = population growth rate\n",
    "           \n",
    "           K = carrying capacity\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we will introduce a harvest term, H, which is the number of fish humans remove from the population by fishing:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{dN}{dt} = rN(1-N/K) - H\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Managers are often tasked with choosing this \"H\" so that the fishery is sustainable -- that is, so that the number of fish does not change from year to year. With a bit of algebra or calculus, you can arrive at the correct choice for H, or you can play with the simulation below."
