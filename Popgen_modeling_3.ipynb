    "## Population Genetics Exercise 3: Modeling Selection and Genetic Drift\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "The zygotes (cells resulting from the combination of one egg gamete and one sperm gamete) of one generation are formed from a sub-sampling of gametes from the parental population. This sub-sample inevitably is an imperfect representation of the alleles found in the parental population. **This sampling error results in chance fluctuations in allele frequency across generations, known as genetic drift.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Genetic drift is one of the five forces that can cause evolutionary change - the loss (where the allele frequency becomes 0) versus fixation (the allele frequency becomes 1) of an allele can be caused by genetic drift.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Selection is a directional evolutionary force, allowing us to predict how likely it is that either a beneficial (selectively advantageous) mutation will eventually become fixed in the population, or that a deleterious (selectively *dis*advantageous) mutation will be eliminated from the population.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We are modifying our hypothetical example from Exercises 1-2. While we are still considering two different alleles (designated A and a) for one gene, we are now looking at the change in the frequency of allele A (designated as the variable p) as selectively either **positive/beneficial (if the selection coefficient S>0)** OR **negative/deleterious (if S<0)** and the frequency of allele a (designated as the variable q) in a population that experiences genetic drift and positive or negative selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "If selection is weak compared to genetic drift, the stochasticity of reproduction can play a role in the trajectory an allele takes, even when the allele is common in the population. If selection is sufficiently weak compared to genetic drift, then genetic drift will dominate the dynamics of alleles and the alleles will behave like theyâ€™re effectively selectively neutral. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a newly arising mutation to eventually get fixed, it first has to escape loss by genetic drift when rare, because even beneficial alleles are susceptible to the stochastic effects of genetic drift when they are very rare or in a small population. Population size holds a fundamental place in understanding evolution because it influences how effective the force of selection is in producing evolutionary change. "
