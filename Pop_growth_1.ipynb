    "\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "The United Nations Population Division projects the world population to reach a staggering 11.2 billion by the end of the 21st century. This significant population growth puts a strain on the ecological system, making it even more crucial to closely monitor its health in the face of challenges like climate change. Studying population growth dynamics using quantitative models allows us to analyze trends and predict future population sizes. This information is essential for making informed decisions about resource management and ensuring sustainability as we navigate a changing climate. In this section, we are going to study two models of population growth: exponential and logistic."
